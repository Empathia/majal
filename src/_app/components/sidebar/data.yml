sectionTitle: Support MAJAL
description: |
  MAJAL is a grassroots not-for-profit movement that operates
  independently of any partisan, corporate, national or regional government,
  institution or organization. Althought some of our costs are covered by
  certain foundations such as the Omidyar Network or the Shuttleworth Foundation,
  we need your support to maintain our primry expenses so that we may focus solely
  on improving our work.
