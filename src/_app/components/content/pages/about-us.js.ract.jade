    p In Arabic and Farsi, Majal translates to "opportunity" or "to give way". In Hindi slang, it means daring or brave. When pronounced in Spanish, it’s “Mahal,” which in Tagalog means love. So in a word, Majal embodies what it is meant to be - a daring act of love that creates opportunities for people around the world.
